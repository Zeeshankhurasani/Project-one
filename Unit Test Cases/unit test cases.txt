The following are the sequence of steps to be followed

Initially take three pointers: 
1.PrevNode 
2.CurrNode 
3.NextNode

Let CurrNode point to HeaderNode of the given list and PrevNode and NextNode points to null
Now iterate through the linked list until CurrNode is null
In the loop, we need to change NextNode to PrevNode, PrevNode to CurrNode and CurrNode to NextNode

Taking 3 pointers: PrevNode, CurrNode and NextNode where CurrNode pointing to HeaderNode

After First Iteration:
After the first iteration of the loop, PrevNode points to the node containing element 1 and CurrNode & NextNode points to the node containing element 2. And the node pointed by PrevNode gets unlinked.

After Second Iteration:
After the second iteration of the loop, PrevNode Points to the node containing element 2 and CurrNode & NextNode point to the node containing element 3. And the CurrNode next would be pointing to PrevNode.


By the end of the iteration, PrevNode contains the reverse of the complete list.
